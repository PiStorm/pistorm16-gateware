// ClockSync module
// ================
// Clock synchronizer provides falling and rising strobes from low-speed 7.14 MHz clock.
// Further, it provides time-shifted signal from nDTACK bus of Amiga. This latch is used
// to control the main FSM.
// The reason of the above is partially screwed timing of A500/A600. There, the nDTACK
// appears somewhere in the middle of S4 state. According to m68k user manual, the data on
// the bus is then latched on falling clock edge of S6->S7 transition. This is fine but
// it could happen already earlier. The manual says that device shall take not longer than 90ns
// to stabilize data bus after asserting DTACK. Amiga does not.
// The delayed DTACK, either hardcoded as a constant or provided from a register is used to 
// fine-tune the delay so that Firmware latches data as soon as possible but not before the
// data is stable. Use with care.
